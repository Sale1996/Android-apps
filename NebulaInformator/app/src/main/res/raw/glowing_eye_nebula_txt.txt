NGC 6751, also known as the Glowing Eye Nebula or Dandelion Puffball Nebula,[citation needed] is a planetary nebula in the constellation Aquila. The nebula is estimated to be around 0.8 light-years in diameter. The star at the centre of the nebula has a surface temperature of approximately 140,000 K. It has been calculated to be roughly 6,500 light-years away from Earth. It was formed when a star collapsed and threw off its outer layer of gas several thousand years ago.

The nebula was the subject of the winning picture in the 2009 Gemini School Astronomy Contest, in which Australian high school students competed to select an astronomical target to be imaged by Gemini.

NGC 6751 is an easy telescopic target for deepsky observers because its location is immediately southeast of the extremely red colored cool carbon star V Aquilae.

According to Harold Corwin, the NGC object NGC 6748 is equal to NGC 6751.
